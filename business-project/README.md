## Tech Stack
```
Languange: HTML, CSS, Javascript
Framework: VueJS, Bootstrap
Library: axios

VueJS is a mandatory framework / library, and VueJS is a stack that is easy and fast to initialize and use

Bootstrap is one of the css templating frameworks which I think is good and the documentation is easy to read, the contents are complete, and we can apply it to other frameworks (eg react)

Axios, for axios itself it's actually just because I'm more familiar
